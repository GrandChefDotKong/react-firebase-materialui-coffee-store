  Progressive Web Application made with react, material-ui and firebase, using payment request API.<br>
  The app is hosted on firebase hosting and you can see it here : https://coffee-shop-1569c.web.app/<br>
  (I recommend to test it in mobile device mode)

  This app is a SPA of a coffee shop, you can login with google auth, add products to your cart and check out.
  As its a WPA, you can install it on your phone home screen.
